# gitAPI

- nightmare mode? i think... it has a custom router, albiet a rudimentary one
- 2 tier routing. state is maintained for the user selected as well as when the branches are expanded
- all branches are queried for all reopsitories
- optional link to gh pages (only if exists)
- custom events for custom objects (onload added to each user obj so that a callback can be applied to display even before data is pulled. this made the router setup more simplified)
